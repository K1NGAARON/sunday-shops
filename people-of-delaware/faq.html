                    This is our partner. It’s a Belgian company from Roeselare and a big player on the market of qualitative branded clothing. They adapted our designs and produced the clothing. Sunday is known for qualitative products and has a great webshop platform that also handles the payments and distribution of the clothes for us.

                    By picking up your gift at the office instead of having it delivered at your door, we are able to cut the carbon emissions resulting from the required transport by 30 %.

                    By encouraging all people of delaware to pick up their gifts in one of the delaware offices, we can limit the required packaging to a bare minimum: only the outer boxes instead of individual packages. Even so all packaging, be it delivered to the office or to your door, will be made from recycled materials.
