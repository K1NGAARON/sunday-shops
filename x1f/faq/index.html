                    The X1F Fashion Line currently includes hoodies, sweaters, polos and t-shirts in various colors. We are working on offering you more pieces or a larger variety of colors in the future. Since we have to have the clothes pre-produced, we will start with this selection and expand the collection bit by bit.
                    <br>
                    If you have concrete wishes for more colors, please leave them <a href="https://x1fgroup.sharepoint.com/sites/X1F/SitePages/en/X1F-Fashion.aspx" target="_blank">here</a> on the X1F SharePoint.

                    If the <span style="font-weight: 700;">item you purchased</span> really doesn't fit, you can pass it on to customers, family members or friends and request a voucher via <a target="_blank" href="mailto:communications@x1f.one">email</a> to order the same item of clothing in a different size.
                    <br><br>
                    Please note that returns are very expensive and in the interest of sustainability and in view of the costs involved, we should all try to avoid them.
                    <br><br>
                    We hope you understand that we can not offer a return for the <span style="font-weight: 700;">free pieces</span>, because we, unlike large webshops, have no capacity for logistics, etc. If your free part really does not fit, please try to exchange it with a colleague in the interest of the group.
