                    The X1F Fashion Line currently includes hoodies, sweaters, polos and t-shirts in various colors. We are working on offering you more pieces or a larger variety of colors in the future. Since we have to have the clothes pre-produced, we will start with this selection and expand the collection bit by bit.
                    <br>
                    If you have concrete wishes for more colors, please leave them here on the X1F SharePoint.

                    All products are unisex and fit true to size (size S - XXXL). Choose the size you normally wear and your piece will fit. If you are unsure which size you need, please have a look at the sizing chart for each product. There you will find all the information to find your size.

                    If the item you purchased really doesn't fit, you can pass it on to customers, family members or friends and request a voucher via email to order the same item of clothing in a different size.
                    <br><br>
                    Please note that returns are very expensive and in the interest of sustainability and in view of the costs involved, we should all try to avoid them.
                    <br><br>
                    We hope you understand that we can not offer a return for the free pieces, because we, unlike large webshops, have no capacity for logistics, etc. If your free part really does not fit, please try to exchange it with a colleague in the interest of the group.
