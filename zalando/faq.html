                    This platform is made for requesting a quote and this is not an order yet. The average lead time is about 6 weeks, but this depends on the product, quantity and design. The Sunday project manager will inform you about the exact delivery date.

                    For the fixed collection, you can't change the design. All designs under the fixed collection tab have been carefully made while respecting the Zalando brand. These designs are also approved by the brand team and have been produced in the past.
                    <br><br>
                    For the customisable collection, you will be able to change certain elements of the design.

                    This is not obligated and the size breakdown can also be discussed after the offer. This way you already know the total budget before putting in the effort of collecting all sizes. We can also assist with collecting the sizes (standard size breaks, size guides, …)

                    This is our partner which we have teamed up with for several projects over the last year. They always provided an excellent service and they helped us with the designs, production of the clothing and are hosting this order platform.
