                    We currently ship within the EU, the US and Canada as part of a test for the Asphalt brand. After we review the results and in celebration of Asphalt's 20th anniversary, we’ll do our best to expand shipping worldwide.

                    As mentioned on the product pages, we’ll be doing a pre-registration for this EU drop. The website will open in early October and remain available for about a week. Once the pre-order period ends, we’ll begin production. After production is complete, your order will be shipped to you.

                    As mentioned above, we are using a pre-registration model. Once the limited-edition drop ends, we’ll produce the merch and ship it directly to your doorstep. You can expect a 1-2 month delivery timeframe after placing your order. Since this is a test to gauge player interest in Asphalt merch, we’ll aim to speed up delivery for the worldwide launch.

Our products generally fit true to size, except for items labeled ""oversized"" (as noted on the product page), which already have a loose fit—you can choose a smaller size for these.
