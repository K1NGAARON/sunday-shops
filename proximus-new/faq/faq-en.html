                    To be clear, we don‚Äôt make any profit on this website. We sell at cost. The prices might come down in the future if our volumes become bigger (for this experiment we only ordered a limited amount of stock).
                    There are two main reasons why we don‚Äôt give these clothes away for free:

                    <li>
                        Sustainability. If there is a price to pay, only people that are really interested (and will really use the clothing) will buy it. If we give this for free, there‚Äôs a big percentage that ends up not being used. I (Peter Van Hende), personally worked here 15+ years and I have to admit that I accumulated quite a few t-shirts and hoodies that my partner forbids me to wear for anything else than gardening üòä.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is a test and we only have a very small budget. If we have to foresee a budget for all Proximus, employees, we end up with a biiiiig budget (in comparison to other, smaller, companies). But if this test turns out to be a positive success, who knows what will happen!

                <p>
                    On the other hand: In return for the price you pay, we made the branding very light, so you don‚Äôt feel like a billboard!

                    In this process, we have learned that designing clothes that everybody likes is very, very hard. Everybody has an opinion, it‚Äôs very subjective and on top of that there are production and budget constraints. We now understand why the world of fashion is so diverse üòä.
