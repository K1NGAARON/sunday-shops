                    Our merch was that good, hey?! üòé Panda Coins are allocated once a year (and pro-rata depending on start date) so you will have to wait until the next year, i.e. 2025, to get your next allocation of Panda Coins.

                    Unfortunately not. There is a checking service which ensures packages are delivered to the location aligned with your Workday profile, therefore if you are assigned to our Vienna hub, your order will go to the office. Not to worry, you can swing by, pick it up and show off your new merch to other pandas!

                    If you notice our Boutique is adding shipping costs on to your order, it means you have ordered too little. We want to ensure that shipping is not only cost efficient, but also ESG friendly. Therefore if all you want is a pair of socks, it might be worth waiting until the next launch, or adding something to your order.

                    As a general rule we do not provide a "returns" option. Please note that returns are very expensive and in the interest of sustainability and in view of the costs involved, we should all try to avoid them. Therefore we ask that you triple-check the sizing details and watch the sizing video before ordering. 
                    <br><br>
                    We hope you understand that we can not offer a return for the free pieces, because we, unlike large webshops, have no capacity for logistics, etc. If your free part really does not fit, please try to exchange it with a colleague in #company-bitpanda-boutique.

                    As we have limited stock of these items, we think it is only fair that all Pandas have an opportunity to grab an item for themselves. Therefore, you are limited to only one item per product, i.e. one t-shirt, of a particular collection. However, if there is stock left during the next shopping window, and if you‚Äôre quick enough, you can grab another one!
