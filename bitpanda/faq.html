                    In order to ensure we are being environmentally conscious, we deliver all packages to our key hubs for those who are located at or near a hub. If you are not based at a hub, please select that option upon checkout and we will deliver to your home address.

                    Unfortunately not. There is a checking service which ensures packages are delivered to the location aligned with your Workday profile, therefore if you are assigned to our Vienna hub, your order will go to the office. Not to worry, you can swing by, pick it up and show off your new merch to other pandas!

                    If you notice our Boutique is adding shipping costs on to your order, it means you have ordered too little. We want to ensure that shipping is not only cost efficient, but also ESG friendly. Therefore if all you want is a pair of socks, it might be worth waiting until the next launch, or adding something to your order.

                    Because we have limited stock of these items, we think it is only fair that all Pandas have an opportunity to snag themselves the items. Therefore, you are limited to only one item per product, i.e. one t-shirt, of a particular collection. However, if there is stock left during the next shopping window, and if you‚Äôre quick enough, you can grab another one!
